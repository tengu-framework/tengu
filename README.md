# Tengu Framework
Tengu is a simple and light weight PHP framework. This project is **not** intended for actual production-ready websites or applications. This is simply a means to learn some of the core fundamentals of typical frameworks and their architecture. As such, Tengu is in no way optimized or as full-featured as other frameworks.

If you're simply looking to learn and build your own framework, then welcome! Otherwise, I highly recommend checking out one of the following frameworks for your project:

- [Laravel](http://laravel.com/)
- [Symfony](http://symfony.com/)
- [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/)
